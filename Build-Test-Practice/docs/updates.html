&nbsp;ZIM DOCS - UPDATES                                                                    <a href="docs.html" class="plain">DOCS</a>

This document lists the changes to ZIM from version to version.
The code that matches these changes can be found on <a href="https://github.com/danzen/zimjs" target="gh" class="plain">GIT HUB</a>.
<em>BREAKS</em> are highlighted below if you will need to change an app when updating it to the new ZIM.
This happens if a parameter position is changed (new parameters might be placed next to related parameters)
or if a method is removed and a replacement property added, etc.
Breaks are kept to a minimum but in "later" parameter cases, ZIM DUO is often used so order is less important
Shifts in names and functionality are also more common in recently added features.

RECOMMENDATION: just leave any finished apps with the version of ZIM that was used at the time
unless you see an <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> that will help your app - then make sure you test after upgrading!


<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.7.1</span>
Added chainable cache() method to Containers and Sprites - this overrides CreateJS cache to operate on bounds by default and return the object for chaining
so all Display Objects that extend a Container such as Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Blob, Squiggle, Label, etc. all get the new cache()
eg. var circle = new Circle(100, frame.red, frame.dark, 5).cache().drag();
cache() will automatically cache the dimensions of the Circle, Rectangle, etc. and add the half borderWidth as well - NOTE that cache is chainable now!
You can still pass in dimensions and if you do, you can just pass the first two parameters as width and height to start x and y at 0.
Or you can pass all four parameters like CreateJS cache() - note, the fifth parameter is scale which can cache at a higher fidelity for later scaling
This is a convenience function for circle.cache(-circle.radius, -circle.radius, circle.radius*2, circle.radius*2);

Added a cur() chainable method for applying a cursor to a CSS cursor string value
eg. var circle = new Circle(100, frame.red, frame.dark, 5).cur("pointer");
This is a convenience function for circle.cursor = "pointer"
The function itself in ZIM is virtually nothing:
zim.cur = function(type) {
	obj.cursor = type;
	return obj;
}
But it allows us to chain and potentially avoid variable names - for example:
var circle = new Circle().center(stage);
circle.cursor = "pointer";
circle.on("click", function(){zgo("http://zimjs.com");});
// becomes 70% the code with:
new Circle().center(stage).cur("pointer").on("click", function(){zgo("http://zimjs.com");});
// remember that on() does not return the object for normal chaining but that is okay if no further reference to the object is needed
// albeit, risky if you change your mind...

Added a sha() chainable method for applying a createjs Shadow() that has defaults or params for color, shiftX, shiftY, blur or a single CreateJS Shadow
eg. var circle = new Circle(100, frame.red, frame.dark, 5).sha().drag();
This is a convenience function for : circle.shadow = new createjs.Shadow("rgba(0,0,0,.3)", 5, 5, 10); // etc.

Updated gesture() and transform() to work properly with masking as well as converted drag(), animate() and Blob() into new mask management
Added a dynamic parameter (default false) to setMask() that runs a Ticker to track and update mask movement.
The Blob and any ZIM Shape that has drag, animate, transform or gesture will set the dynamic property to true (unless it was explicitly set to false)
A Shape() that is used for a mask does not have to be dynamic as it is directly applied as the mask
If you are going to mask with a ZIM shape (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) and then manually transform the mask for instance, mask.sca(2);
then either setMask with dynamic of true or setMask after the transformation
<em>BREAK</em> - <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - made setMask() return object for chaining - now that dynamic is set no need really to return mask object instead use mask.zimMask
<em>BREAK</em> - Added count (total tiles) parameter to after cols and rows for ZIM Tile - in case you do not want all columns filled on last row.
Added factor parameter to Swiper (default 1) is going the same direction and -1 is going in opposite direction
Updated Swiper to recognize damp parameter
Added swipestop event to Swiper for when motion stops after swipeup
Adjusted added() method to clear longer interval if shorter interval detects stage
Adjusted Blob and Squiggle to not check for stage updates when not on stage due to removeFrom stage - was working fine for toggle but not if manually removed
Added slidestop event to drag() docs
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.7.0</span>
Added devicemotion event to Frame - eg. frame.on("devicemotion", function(e) {zog(e.acceleration.x, e.acceleration.y, e.acceleration.z)});
Added Portal(obj, lands) to controls module.
Portal lets you travel between lands (screens, etc.) by rolling over an object - the portal.
It handles masking the land through the portal and the land management - dispatches enter and exit events
Here is an example http://zimjs.com/code/portal
<em>BREAK</em> - changed "relative" parameters and properties in Dial to "continuous" for better clarity - and continuousMin and continuousMax
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.6.4</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted Dial and Slider keypress to be independent of other keydown commands (like MotionController)
Added keyArrowsH and keyArrowsV to Dial and Slider that default to true - can now turn off left/right or up/down control
Fixed arrow control on limit=false to allow multiple revolutions
Fixed arrows on relative setting of Dial
Fixed ticks for slider with max that is smaller than min
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.6.3</span>
Adjusted docs to say Dial has default step of 1 (not 0 as docs had said).
Added multitouch to Dial - Slider and drag() already have multitouch.
Added relative, relativeMin and relativeMax parameters to Dial
Added relativeMin, relativeMax get set properties to Dial and made min and max writeable for when relative is true
This uses max-min as amount per revolution and continues to add or subtract accordingly
http://zimjs.com/code/etch/ for Etch A Sketch example
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.6.2</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added raw() method to zim.Ticker() that directly adds a function to a requestAnimationFrame
Also added a removeRaw() method to remove a raw function with an id made by var id = Ticker.raw(function)
This gives ultimate speed without calling the library system of Ticker.add()
Ticker.add() should still be used in general for multiple ticker calls or calls along with zim animate, etc.
But use raw() for dynamic art for instance where you have one butter smooth ticker.
You need to call stage.update() in the raw() function
We could have called stage.update() but it would run the risk of duplicating the update if the coder also put it in
Updated Scroller to add second object to the same layer as the original object
so no need to add Scroller objects to containers <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added flip and flipVertical parameters to Dynamo to flip the Sprite if speed is negative and reversible is false.
This was done by the coder previously - so it might BREAK a project where it was already done... <em>BREAK</em>
Also changed reversable parameter to reversible for proper spelling ;-)  <em>BREAK</em>
Added convertColor() to DISTILL
Adjusted DISTILL to properly access ZIM namespace without ZNS set to true
Adjusted Frame to create a random canvasID if the frame is not the default frame and no canvasID is provided
Added canvasID property to Frame to provide String of the canvasID - could also use frame.canvas.id
Fixed glitch in makeID() so default is indeed mixed
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.6.1</span>
Added isJSON function to test for JSON string.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted ZIM gesture to rotate and scale around pinch point.
Added regControl parameter (default false) to gesture go back to rotating and scaling around registration point.
Fixed chaining of stopAnimate and pauseAnimate.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.6.0</span>
DOCS:
Removed namespace from documentation titles and doc examples
Remember that the namespace can still be used. It can also be required by setting zns=true before importing ZIM
Tidied up the function listings to not include title = function(parameters) but rather title(parameters)
Added a text version of the docs for easy import into other viewing systems like PDF (thanks Vishwas Gagrani)

SQUIGGLE:
Added ZIM Squiggle - like a blob but only a line
Squiggle has pretty well all the blob features including TransformManager support
Squiggle does not have borderColor, borderWidth nor radius but rather has color, thickness and length
It also defaults to "mirror" as the type of control rather than "straight" which the Blob defaults to

BUTTON:
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added wait, waitTime, waitColor, rollWaitColor, waitTextColor, rollWaitTextColor, waitModal, waitEnabled parameters to the end of the Button parameters.
Added clearWait() and removeWait() methods, a waiting property and a waited event which is dispatched if the waitTime is reached.
For wait backings and icons use the setBackings() and setIcons() methods along with the waited event to handle changes.
<em>BREAK</em> - inserted a borderRollColor parameter before borderWidth which is before corner.
Any existing buttons with traditional parameters up to corner will broken - an extra null will have to be inserted before borderWidth.
Also added a borderRollColor property to the zim Button.
Since the parameter order has changed, moved dashed to after flatBottom parameter - to match Rectangle.
Added wait parameters to Tabs and Pad as well and added gradient and gloss to Pad

PANE:
Added the following parameters to ZIM Pane()
bar - (default null - no bar) a String or ZIM Label title for the pane that will be presented on a bar across the top
barColor - (default "rgba(0,0,0,.2)") the background color of the bar if a bar is requested
barHeight - (default fit label) the height of the bar if a bar is requested
close - (default false) - a close X for the top right corner that closes the pane when pressed
closeColor - (default #555) - the color of the close X if close is requested
Also added bar, barColor, barBacking, and close properties to access these objects
Fixed TextArea and Loader inside Pane add/removal problem - was using Dictionary objects list rather than values list
Also for multiple TextAreas was not looping through container backwards when removing so was missing an item
<em>BREAK</em> changed the backingAlpha to backdropColor to offer more flexibility for the backdrop
use "rgba(0,0,0,.5)" etc. for dark and "rgba(256,256,256,.5)" for light - and of course colors as well.
You can use a solid color and then drop the alpha with pane.backdrop.alpha = .2 - not alp() as backing is CreateJS shape.

HITTESTCIRCLES:
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added ZIM hitTestCircles() method to all display objects.
This tests if two circle shapes are hitting using an equation based on cirles made from bounds
If the bounds are not square, the circles are averaged - the radius is half the average of the lengths of its sides
(This is different than hitTestCircle() where the points around the "circle" actually stretch to an oval with the bounds)
obj.hitTestCircles(obj2) is a calculation based on intersecting circles so is faster than shape hitTests
It will be as fast as hitTestBounds and hitTestGrid.
hitTestCircles second parameter is a margin number value which can be positive or negative to tweak the hitTest
A margin parameter has been added to hitTestBounds as well before the boundsShape

OTHER:
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added zim.previewAudioSprite() to the META module to create tabs with each sound in an AudioSprite for easy preview
Adjusted parseAudioSprite() to clarify that it returns a CreateJS AudioSprite object
<em>BREAK</em> - adjusted Blob to have a setData() method rather than a set() method so the general set() method is not obscured
<em>BREAK</em> - adjusted transform() transformObject to have a setData() method rather than a set() method to be consistent with Blob and Squiggle
NOTE: transform has a transformObject which is a custom object - not a Display object so set() is fine there but wanted to be consistent
<em>BREAK</em> - adjusted Blob and the transformObject to have recordData() methods rather than record() methods
These now match - recordData(), setData(), recordPoints(), setPoints() - sorry for the adjust but should be settled now.
Also adjusted the Docs on Blobs to update the single click edit.
Also adjusted the Docs on the Blob's points property to indicate a different format for setting and getting points.
Adjusted TextArea and Loader to use zim.added() to test for the stage and then on("added") to test for re-adding after
Fixed a glitch in Stepper so the downForward parameter works as expected
Added read only num property to Blob (to match Squiggle's num property) for number of points
Added error support for font loading so load completes if font is missing - takes the timeout though of 8 seconds
which is not ideal but could not seem to capture immediate bad URL error with error or fileerror events
Fixed Stepper to set correct selectedIndex when stepping through number list that does not start at 0 and make sure enabled has this number when set to true
Gave Pane and Indicator enabled properties like most other components
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - adjusted TextArea to have a background-color of rgba(0,0,0,.01) so cursor and selection highlight shows up (was at transparent - weird that would affect selection)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - adjusted zim.drag() so the last drag added is the only drag on the object
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added a dynamically created audio tag for the first audio loaded to jumpstart audio on some Apple devices
Thanks Bart Libert for reporting and testing the issue.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.5.0</span>
AUDIOSPRITES:
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added support for AudioSprites with frame.loadAssets() and frame.asset()
Added outputAudioSprite parameter to loadAssets() to show converted AudioSprite data when using ZIM AudioSprite format
Added parseAudioSprite() function to META section for parsing AudioSprite data from https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite

TRANSFORM, BLOB and TRANSFORM MANAGER:
Added a transformType property to the transformed event object for transform()
This has values of "scale", "move", "rotate", "stretchX", "stretchY", "reg" "reset"
Added objects and persistID to the start of ZIM TransformManager() parameters
<em>BREAK</em> The unique parameter has been removed now that transform works with single click
Added currentObject and persistData properties to TransformManager
Added EVENTS to TransformManager:
1. transformed event when pressup on any of the controls or on click
transformed event object has transformObject and transformType properties
the transformType property has values of:
FOR TRANSFORM: "size", "move", "rotate", "stretch", "reg" "reset"
FOR BLOB: "move", "bezierPoint", "bezierHandle", "bezierSwitch"
2. transformshow and transformhide events for when click to hide or show controls
these have a transformObject property to indicate what was shown or hidden
Added a dispose(removePersist, removeControls) method to TransformManager
Added a dispose() to the transformControls for any transformed object to remove transform controls and events
Made Blob and transform / TransformManager only trigger change or transform events when a property value changes
Previously, a change would happen on mousedown and pressup but now there has to be a different x or y
Same with all handles, scaling, rotating, reg, etc.

SHAPE BITMAP and GRADIENT FILLS:
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added colorCommand and borderColorCommand properties to ZIM shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Blob)
These allow you to set Bitmap, linearGradient and radialGradient fills on the shapes (through CreateJS Graphic objects)
Thanks Samual Jacquinet for the prompting!

OTHER UPDATES:
Fixed Waiter.dispose() method when short wait times - thanks Ami Hanya
zim.hitTestPoint, hitTestReg, hitTestRect, hitTestCircle got a new last parameter - boundsCheck (default true)
Set this to false to not do a bound intersection check first
This would be slower but if the bounds are wrong (such as with blobs) the parameter should be set to true
to make sure that only the shape is used and not filtered by the faster bounds test.
Adjusted ZIM Blob to fix bounds issue due to above.
<em>BREAK</em> - no longer clone the cursor property when cloning an object - that can lead to unexpected results - but let us know if you disagree
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.4.1</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> fixed memory leak in transform() that was leaving mousemove events due to using wrong variable name
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> <em>BREAK</em> removed dblclick parameter and replaced with toggle parameter for single click editing
This is much more intuitive and has been set to a default of true.
So click on shows controls and click off hides controls.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> <em>BREAK</em> changed dblclick parameter for zim.Blob() to toggle to match transform()
Also changed Blob to single click to show and hide controls.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> <em>BREAK</em> made blobs drag when controls are active to match transform() and most editing tools
and changed dblclickDrag parameter to move to match transform() and default move to true (set to false to turn off dragging)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> <em>BREAK</em> added a handleSize parameter to Blob just before the toggle parameter that sets the handle size like with transform
This defaults to 20 on mobile and 10 on not mobile ;-)
<em>BREAK</em> changed the record() method of Blob to recordPoints() which matches format when creating a Blob
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> and then added new record() and set() methods that work together for updating already created Blobs
This was so that Blob objects can be added to the zim.TransformManager just objects with transforms
You will need to make a basic Blob with the correct number of points.
Also added a setPoints() method that sets the points of an existing Blob that match the recordPoints
Strategy - if you want to create Blobs from data use the recordPoints and pass that data into the points parameter.
If you want to adjust an existing Blob then use the setPoints() method
If you want to record more than just the point data - for instance, x, y, color, etc. then use record() and set()
Or let the TransformManager handle it - it uses the new record() and set() similar to the transformControls record() and set() methods.
Also adjusted zim.setMask() to help handle dragging of a Blob object as a mask and added an example to the setMask docs
as well as an update to the snake at http://zimjs.com/code/zoo.html
Updated the other animals too including adding clone() to lion assets for multiple lions, putting snake into a function for multiple snakes
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - made zim.TransformManager also handle Blob objects as mentioned above - including the saving of, resizing and handling show and hide
Added getQueryString() method to return the HTML query string ?var=val&var2=val2 as an object with matching properties
Thanks Ami Hanya for the suggestion.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - added loadTimeout parameter to frame.loadAssets() with a default of 8000ms - this is how long to wait for assets
Thanks Jonghyun Kim for suggestion and to CreateJS for already having that in the LoadQueue
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> - adjusted frame.asset() to have a default "Broken Image" object (ZIM Circles) when asset is not available.
This can be adjusted with the new loadFailObj parameter for zim.Frame() - the object will have a type property of "EmptyAsset"
Also made loadAssets() accept a ZIM DUO configuration object.
Made loadAssets() work with files without extensions.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.4.0</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added font support to zim.loadAssets() - for urls to fonts and also Google fonts
Pass in font in format {font:name, src:url, type:string, weight:string, style:string}
Any number of fonts can be passed in along with images, sound, etc. to loadAssets()
The name is what you give it and you would use that name in a zim.Label({font:"name"})
If you use http at the start of the font src it ignores the path parameter for that font
This allows you to use your own fonts in a directory but also add google fonts in the same loadAssets.
This piggy backs on CreateJS FontLoader() but consolidates the format and combines with other assets to load
Added a backdropClose parameter to zim.Pane() - thanks Ami Hanya for the prompting
<em>BREAK</em> moved the container parameter to the end of zim.Pane as most panes are added to the stage.
In the past, ZIM did not know the stage but now it has a ZimDefaultFrame with its stage
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.3.3</span>
UPDATED all ZIM Bits to version 6.3.3 using chaining, no namespace and loop throughout.
Would recommend, this way of coding - see http://zimjs.com/code/tips.html
Note: The ZIM Capture video series has not been updated and probably will not be.
<em>BREAK</em> the scale() method has been depreciated and removed - use sca() which works the same way
The new CreateJS has a scale property so ball.scale = 3; will set both scaleX and scaleY.
It appears that scale will read the scaleX.  So, no more scale() method in ZIM.
Instead you can use sca() for chaining and then scale, scaleX and scaleY for properties.
<em>BREAK</em> - changed parameter order for TextArea and Loader - sorry - moved frame parameter to end
We now have zimDefaultFrame which will do in most cases and if we are in a second frame then pass that in to the frame paremeter
Added focus() property to TextArea  (thanks Armin for the prompting) before was textArea.tag.focus() piggy-backing on JS focus of HTML tag
Adjusted OPTIMIZE, ANIMATE and DISTILL constants to work without the zim namespace with zns false - accidentally made them work when zns was true (so swapped)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Fixed a glitch in run() method of Sprite() to allow for replay of non-label Sprites
since the change to normalized playback supporting non-sequential frames in SpriteSheets animations
Adjusted zim.place() to return object for chaining
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted zim.Rectangle to draw a normal rectangle if the corner is 0 was drawing a rounded rectangle with corner 0
then realized the border was not mitred as expected - it had little rounded corners instead of 90 degrees.
Updated zim.Accessibility() to put a z-index back to -5 that was accidentally left at 5 for testing.  Thanks Frank for the find.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.3.2</span>
Added split property to Parallax object to center the input value (with mouseX this defaults to true - the others false)
Thanks Raman for the prompting! <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
<em>BREAK</em> Adjusted Parallax parameter order to layers, damp, auto, stage and give the object the default frame's stage
With the scrollX, scrollY chrome fix, this is a good time to adjust the stage parameter - it is the last of the ZIM classes left requiring a stage since the default frame addition.
This was primarily due to parallax being its own module without Frame - but now ZIM has Distill, so it is not that big a deal to loose parity with the old stand-alone parallax module.
Fixed mouseY to use stageH as default inMax rather than stageW (bug)
Adjusted scrollX and scrollY to test for document.documentElement && document.documentElement["scroll"+side]) || document.body["scroll"+side]
Before was assuming Safari only used documentElement and Chrome, Edge, Firefox worked fine - then Chrome seems to have changed its mind...
The Chrome change will <em>BREAK</em> any previous Parallax scrolls with scrollbar (not mouse) so if you made one, upgrade to this ZIM and it will not be broken.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> And newer ZIM has a Frame parameter called allowDefault - set that to true to let mobile scroll on canvas.
Any old Sprite work with Parallax, will probably need to set {spriteSheet:spriteSheet} as that parameter position changed a while back.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.3.1</span>
Added cache parameter to transform() and automatically cache the handles and cursors unless set to false
Added a outerColor property to ZIM Frame() to set the color of the HTML body (background-color style)
Added outerColor parameter to the end of the ZIM Frame() class
Adjusted tweek in Sprite.run() to handle non-label input - that got lost with a previous change.  <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added startType parameter to wiggle() defaults to both but can set to positive to start positive or negative to start negative
Added onTop parameter to Blob so dragging it when controls gone defaults to brining the shape on top but can set to false to avoid this
Added snapToPixel parameter to Tile that defaults to true - this helps moved Tiles not have tiny gap
And added Tile parameters to documentation ;-)
Fixed Blob() and transform() to work with dblclick on mobile to toggle edit mode. <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.3.0</span>
Created a transform() method for display objects that makes resize and rotate with little square handles, etc.
Added a TransformManager() class to handle multiple transforms and save / load data.
This is quite spectacular and is heading towards visual editors - perhaps even for ZIM HEP (7).
Thanks Ami Hanya for the idea and the prompting - hope this helps!
Made centerReg and outline return obj even if bounds not set (logs a warning)
Added stage.preventSelection = false; if frame's allowDefault parameter is true <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
This fully allows mobile swiping, etc. to scroll a page when on the canvas (thanks Jonghyun)
The Manager lost its resizing when moved to support the new ResizeManager - that is back.
Fixed remove for one object in Manager
Switched zimify() to require third parameter true for adding scale - will be depreciating scale() due to conflict with new CreateJS 1.1
Start using sca() instead.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.2.2</span>
Added frame.red to colors (thanks Alexa!)
Fixed glitch in Sprite.run() with wait, waitedCall, waitedParams.
These were just being passed through to zim.animate() but were left all as wait property names - oopsy.
Added pauseAnimate() and stopAnimate() methods (and functions) to basically replace pauseZimAnimate and stopZimAnimate
This depreciates the last two - which were titled that early on as dynamic methods before ZIM 4TH methods
All dynamic methods and properties had ZIM in them to avoid conflict
but now that methods are common, there is no need for ZIM in the method name ;-).
Fixed scale() which was turned off for glitch with setMask
Traced it to a possible conflict with canvas scale() method only with new CreateJS 1.0 and if other interactivity! - weird.
So scale() is back - all is well.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.2.1</span>
Updated defaults for mic with SoundWave for baseline (0) and magnify (1).
Also cut the value off at 0 as it was going negative due to changes in ZIM 6.1.1
Glitch in zimify() when applying scale() - might be conflicting with CreateJS Shape and Canvas scale() method?
So removed scale() from zimify() - use sca() instead.
Adjusted ZIM Pages to set pages to original alpha rather than 1 after a transition.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.2.0</span>
Updated ZIM to work with createjs.min.js the new CreateJS 1.0.0. <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
There were a few minor depreciations to take care of:
getStage() became stage, setPaused() became pause, getNumChildren() became numChildren
These were like that to support versions older than 2015 but there is no real use in that now.
Note the gpu parameter of Frame that defaults to false.
Set this to true to use StageGL which is the major part of the release.
See bubbling video when we were preparing for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjyUpYdsM8
Added zim.Noise() class that makes OpenSimplex noise for art, terrains, etc.
http://zimjs.com/code/noise/
This is part of the Code module along with Damp and Proportion, etc.
Added a zim.Tile() class to let you tile an object (or objects with a ZIM VEE value).
You can choose set col and row parameters, add optional spacing and mirror as you tile.
This extends a zim.Container() and is part of the Display module.
Added a zim.smoothStep(min, max, input) function to the code module.
This takes an input value and outputs a value between 0 and 1
that represents a transition between the min and max with easing at both ends.
If you want the easing to be more pronounced, then reduce difference between min and max.
If the value falls outside the min or max it is set to the min or max.
Remember the return value is between 0 and 1 so you can multiply by max-min and add it to min
to get a value at the original scale.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> added drawImageData() method and imageData property to zim.Bitmap().
This allows you to draw pixel data into a Bitmap as you can with raw Canvas.
There is also reference to the proxyCanvas and the proxyContext for the canvas the Bitmap uses as source.
<em>BREAK</em> - there are new width and height parameters for Bitmap that come before the id parameter (breaks order).

<span class="version">ZIM 6.1.1</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Made Sprite.run() work with non-sequential frames and nested labels and next calls
(see CreateJS SpriteSheet docs for format of animation data - which can be specified in a JSON file).
The Dynamo was already working with these and now the run() method does as well.
Adjusted cloned sprites to have different default ids - as pauseRun() was pausing all cloned sprites ;-)
Made pauseRun and stopRun chainable.
Added a flowthrough override for zik() by passing value as {noZik:value}
which allows arrays and functions to be passed through as a value rather than something for zik to process.
Updated SoundWave with the following <strong>IMPROVEMENTS</strong> to the parameters:
baseline - removes this amount of amplitude from each data point (after operation is applied)
magnify - multiplies the data point by this much (after the baseline is removed)
reduce - subtracts this amount from each data point (after magnified)
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6.1.0</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Made zim.Accessibility work on iOS and mostly on Android - Stepper, Slider, Dial and ColorPicker still need work
<em>BREAK</em> - changed applicationName to appName, and highlight to alwaysHighlight and the parameters following are prefixed with AH
This is a solid week of programming for iOS Voice Over - visit on Slack for learnings and advice
Still untested on stand-alone screen readers but good on Windows Narrator, and the mobile readers.
Added currentValueEvent properties to Slider, Dial to get or set value and dispatch event if set changes value
normally, if we are setting a value with code, we can do whatever we would do in the event at that time
but with accessibility, on mobile, the options are being set by HTML and we want to trigger the event
Added a text property to the RadioButton button containers
Added a zim.ResizeManager() that extends zim.Manager and handles resizing Accessibility, Layout, Pages, Grid, Guide, TextArea and Loader
This is just a small class - a few lines of code.
Note - the Accesibility resize() will call any loader or text areas inside it...
<em>BREAK</em> Added decimals parameter to Accessibility before frame parameter
<em>BREAK</em> for the following:
	Adjusted Stepper type parameter to stepperType parameter to avoid conflict with new type property for all Display Objects
	Adjusted CheckBox type parameter to indicatorType parameter to avoid conflict with new type property for all Display Objects
	Adjusted Dial type parameter to indicatorType parameter to avoid conflict with new type property for all Display Objects
	Adjusted Indicator type parameter to indicatorType parameter to avoid conflict with new type property for all Display Objects
<em>BREAK</em> - changed buttons property of RadioButtons to an array rather than container - to match buttons array in Tabs and Pad
Made points property of Blob read and write instead of just read
Added functionality for selectedIndex and stepperArray of Stepper to work with "number" stepperType
Changed currentIndex to selectedIndex for Stepper - BREAKS - matches property name with other components (sorry)
Updated docs for TextArea to include size parameter which was there all along...
Adjusted Dial docs to read default 1 for step.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 6</span>
Made ZIM Accessible - <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added zim.Accessibility() class to handle tabbing to any ZIM Display Object and send messages to Screen Readers
http://zimjs.com/code/screenreader has a detailed example
You basically pass zim.Accessibility() an array of objects (with optional titles)
These will be tabbed to if they are on the stage and the title or a default title sent to the Screen Reader
There is also a talk() method to be able to send a message to the Screen Reader at any time
Gave all ZIM Display objects a type property that matches the class name as a String (case sensitive)
<em>BREAK</em> - removed former (marked as temporary) work with tab order in Tabs, Stepper, and Frame - this is all replaced and updated in zim.Accessibility()
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted Window to handle removing of Window while being rolled over (thanks Frank Los for the bug report)
Added SLACK support discussions https://zimjs.slack.com
Removed clone override from Swipe, Frame, and a few others that did not need it - just an oversight
indicator.currentIndex is now constrained from -1 to num-1 where num is the number of lights
Added readerDecimals parameter to Slider and Dial with default 2 decimal places the screen reader will read
Added keyArrows parameter to Slider, Dial and ColorPicker for arrow key usage if in focus
Added keyArrowsStep parameters to Slider, Dial so Screen Reader does not read all the decimals
Adjusted bar of slider for positioning when pressed - was half a step off due to button registration change - <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Also expanded hitArea on bar - <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added spellCheck parameter to TextArea - default true but can set to false
Added an allowDefault parameter to zim.Frame that passes value through to CreateJS Touch.enable() method's third parameter
Note: the third parameter does not seem to be working so an issue has been added to CreateJS GitHub - thanks Jonghyun Kim for working on this with us
https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS/issues/898
This will also prevent Frame from using zil to keep the canvas still
You can set allowDefault to false and then manually remove the zil events for specific key or scrollwheel functionality
Although the ZIM namespace was removed in 5.5.0, it will be handy to remember that from version 6 on, the ZIM namespace is not required
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.5.0</span>
Added zimplify() global function. Note - this is different than zimify()
zimplify() removes the requirement to use the zim namespace <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Made full, fit and outside Frame template automatically call zimplify()
You can control this with the new namespace parameter of zim.Frame()
So for instance once you make a new zim.Frame() inside, you no longer need the zim namespace
var circle = new Circle(rand(100,300), frame.green).center(stage); // will work
Note: there is no zim namespace before Circle - used to be new zim.Circle()
Note: do not call variables the same as zim functions:
var rand = rand(100); // as rand() will no longer work after this!
The zim namespace still works.
zimplify(exclude) has an exclude parameter that lets you pass in a string command or an array of string commands
and then these will require the zim namespace
zim.wiggle() now supports ZIM DUO configuration object parameter (Thanks Frank Los for prompting)
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.4.0</span>
Added zim.gesture() with pan, pinch and rotate multitouch gestures for position, scale and rotation
zim.gesture() features a bounding rect, min and max scales, rotational snapping and pan sliding.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> This is a new method under the Methods module for all ZIM Display objects
Also added associated zim.noGesture() and zim.gestureRect() Methods
for removing some or all of the gestures (and paradoxically, adding them back)
and dynamically setting the bounding rectangle for the gestures.
Works with the touch parameter set to true for zim.Frame() which is the default setting.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.3.2</span>
Adjusted zim.decimals() so that addZeros is the number of 0 spaces after the decimal
addZeros is no longer a Boolean <em>BREAKS</em>
and a new parameter, addZerosBefore, is the number of 0 spaces before the decimal
Also added a time parameter that just turns the decimal dot into a colon to handle minutes and seconds
Added a total property to the ZIM intervalObject for the zim.interval() that is -1 for infinite
Added a "clear" transition type to Pages that fades out the old page then fades in the new page each at half the transition time
Added transitioning property to pages so can test if pages are in transition (as they are cached)
Adjusted docs - the radius of a zim.Circle is its real radius before scaling and setting the radius redraws the shape
as opposed to width and height which are not necessarily the bounds but can be a scaled value
Fixed multitouch with ZIM - was using: if (touch) createjs.Touch.enable(stage, true);
And yet unfortunately, the second parameter is true for singleTouch! Ouch.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> So now using: createjs.Touch.enable(stage);
Adjusted zim.drag() so that drag Ticker is not removed if any touches are still active
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.3.1</span>
Added simple array of pages to Pages class if you do not need swipe data for each page
Also, now use the default stage as the default for the holder of Pages and moved the holder parameter to the end
<em>BREAKS</em> - this breaks the parameter order of the Pages class
Since introducing the default stage, there are a few of these breaks.
Swapped zim.Ticker.has(function, stage) as stage will default to default stage <em>BREAKS</em> parameter order
<em>BREAKS</em> - moved the index to the second parameter of center and centerReg and the add to the last parameter
as more often than not, we are using centerReg and center to add the object to the stage and
the second most popular parameter is the level (index).  Sorry, this breaks the parameter order for older apps
Added an optional index value for Pages go() so can use page object or an index matching the pages array order
<strong>ENHANCEMENT</strong> - added a check to zim.Ticker.add() so that it will not add the same function more than once
added blendMode property to all zim Display objects that is the same as compositeOperation
Fixed a glitch in Dial when min is greater than max - the ticks were not showing (used Math.abs() for tickNumber)
Adjusted ColorPicker to default to drag of false if there is no buttonBar.
<strong>ENHANCEMENT</strong> - fixed intermittent zim.interval() run-on after clear()
<strong>ENHANCEMENT</strong> - zim.Emitter() had a faulty assignment to "this" in the added function affecting dispose() on multiple emitters
Thanks Frank Los for reporting the bug
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.3.0</span>
Added ZIM SoundWave() to get frequencies from sounds or mic
Also adjusted the order of ZIM and the Documentation to the following:
WRAP - CODE - DISPLAY - METHODS - CONTROLS - FRAME - META
Display (formerly Build) has the basic display elements, shapes and components
Methods (formerly Create) have the methods that all display objects have like drag(), center(), etc.
Controls (formerly Pages) have objects for layout, swiping, pages, motion, parallax, etc.
Removed zim.addDisplayMembers() and fully replaced it with zimify() <em>BREAK</em>
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.2.2</span>
Adjusted interval doc description to include ZIM VEE and zik.
Added color parameter to Pane in the docs.
Adjusted glitch in Tabs when assigning widths to tabs without widths.
Added ZIM VEE and zik to control length of Blob so random blobs can be made
Added rotation, scaleX and scaleY read only properties to MotionController
and adjusted so no object is needed - now we can use MotionController as pure data
Adjusted zim.wiggle() to work on non display objects.
Added time property in the Docs for the zim.interval obj return value
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.2.1</span>
Adjusted zim.Emitter to properly set pool number when ZIM VEE values passed for num and interval
Now uses min of interval and max of num options - would recommend not pooling if using function values for either of these
Also fixed removing of particles if pooling is turned off
Adjusted the pause method of the zim.timeout return object - so unpausing plays the remaining time properly
Made zim.animate and zim.move apply zik before splitting scale into scaleX and scaleY so aspect ratio is kept
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.2.0</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added StageGL support to ZIM Frame - as a gpu parameter which defaults to false - so set to true for WebGL
CreateJS provides an isWebGL property of the stage you can use to get whether WebGL is being used
Added gpuObject parameter to specify extra stageGL parameters
Added refresh to resize for StageGL
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added nextFrame parameter to frame to pass interaction to next stage (for regular Stage and StageGL)
Added zim.convertColor() to convert from string to hex or hex to string (StageGL color accepts hex only)
Added spriteSheet parameter to zim.Sprite to accept a CreateJS spriteSheet
Prior to this the Sprite would make a SpriteSheet from JSON or image and parameters input
This was added because of the cool CreateJS SpriteSheetBuilder to dynamically create SpriteSheets from Shapes, etc. at run time
Fixed the clone property of Sprite
Adjusted Grid and Guide to auto add to obj parameter or the default stage - and fixed interval bug since zim.added() was used (thanks malus on GitHub)
Fixed bug in zim.Frame where two full mode canvases were turning off Ticker stage updates on the first canvas when resized
Fixed bug in zim.Frame was referencing keyword frame in key events when it should have been a reference to the object (that)
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5.1.0</span>
Added a zim.Blob class to make editable blobs - with bezier curves
This is added after zim.Triangle and is very similar to the other zim shapes but a blob ;-)
Blob has a number of types of bezier curves that can be accessed by double clicking the points
Edits to the Blob can be recorded with the record() method and then recreated by passing the recording into points parameter
Created a global variable zimDefaultFrame for the first frame made
zim.Ticker.add(function, stage) and other Ticker functions no longer require stage
The zimDefaultFrame's stage will be used if left out of add()
This is fine for the majority of times when there is only one stage
BUT - if more frames are used then the associated stage needs to be passed to update that stage
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Added a failed event to frame for when canvas is not supported (thanks Frank Los for the prompting)
Added a type parameter to wiggle() so it can wiggle negative, positive or both (default)
Adjusted zim.interval to unpause immediately as an option
Made outline() mouseEnabled = false;
Made ticks a zim.Shape rather than a createJS.shape so it has ZIM 4TH methods
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted zim Emitter pause for the freeze - for some reason not reading stored that.zimEmitter... used local variable instead
Added frame.altKey, frame.ctrlKey, frame.metaKey, frame.shiftKey properties to specify key states
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Made Pane close and drag automatically resize TextArea and Loader objects (due to HTML overlay)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted Loader to save as png by default or can specify type parameter of "jpeg" for jpeg (png more widely accepted)
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 5</span>
ZIM VEE AND ZIK
Introduced ZIM VEE (Roman Numeral 5) values that let you submit options for parameters to be chosen later (uses the new zik() function)
Added zik() global function to pick randomly from an Array or a function result or a random number based on
an object with min, max, integer, negative properties like the params for zim.rand()
ZIM EMITTER AND WIGGLE
Added zim.Emitter() to emit particles for fireworks, smoke, flames, falling objects, hair, grass, etc.
This is a large class with 30 parameters some of which accept ZIM VEE values
Examples can be found here: http://zimjs.com/code/particles
Added zim.wiggle() to randomly go back and forth between the value passed to it - uses zik() and animate()
ZIM ANIMATE AND MOVE
Adjusted zim.move and zim.animate to accept ZIM VEE values for many of the parameters
Including obj, set and props properties and overall parameters except for params, loopParams, waitParams, sequenceParams
These will then be filtered through zik() to pick a random values
This allows for a delay before a random value is picked - handy for passing info as a parameter
Used by zim.Emitter() for instance to pass random properties and animate settings
Added feature to zim.animate and zim.move to animate relative to current property value
To do this the parameter value in the animation object is put in a string - can include negative sign
Also works with the set parameter to set relative starting values
Fixed rewind with set parameter active - hopefully that works - gets complicated
zim.move() and zim.animate() - added waitedCall, loopWaitCall and rewindWaitCall to call functions after waiting and before loopWait and rewindWait
zim.move() and zim.animate() - added waitedParams, loopWaitParams and rewindWaitParams to pass params to above (or callbacks receive the target)
This <em>BREAK</em> parameter order - sorry!  Hopefully by this time you are using ZIM DUO configuration object technique
Adjusted rewindCall and loopCall to happen after rewindWait and loopWait - so this may <em>BREAK</em> as it was before the waits!
Fixed a glitch in stopZimAnimate(ids) when removing animation with ids with single animations across multiple targets - now works
GENERAL ADJUSTMENTS
Fixed zim.Label used Number.isNaN which is not supported on mobile so changed to older double test. <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Fixed a bug in zim.copy - an undeclared var was flattening nested objects
Adjusted zim.copy to ignore objects that are not an object literal - now will copy references to zim objects rather than breaking
Adjusted zim.Triangle() adjust parameter to move shape rather than registration - could <em>BREAK</em> location of triangles
as usually you are adjusting the centerReg and that just was negating the adjustment
Added rotation to cloning of props - this was an oversight <em>BREAK</em> - but in a good way
adjusted clone for shapes to clone latest color and border properties
(and width and height for Rectangle and radius for Circle) possible <em>BREAK</em>
Added read only framerate property to docs for zim.Ticker - use setFPS() to set framerate
Added a has(stage, function) static method to zim.Ticker to check if the Ticker has that function for that stage
Fixed a glitch in zim.interval where it was occasionally not pausing due to race condition
Adjusted obj.clear to before the next() function in zim.timeout to prevent errors on occasion
Added an zim.added() function and ZIM 4TH method to check if object has been added to the stage
CreateJS has an "added" event that triggers when an object is added to another container
but this container may not be on the stage.
added polls with a setInterval every 100ms to see if the object has a stage property
Once it does then it calls the callback and removes the interval
Adjust scaleTo to take into account current scale - this could <em>BREAK</em> code if you had accommodated this already
Adjusted zim.rand() with respect to a=0, b=0 explicit parameters
was returning Math.random() now returns 0.  Only no parameters return Math.random() - might <em>BREAK</em>
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.9.2</span>
Added zim.angle(x1, y1, x2, y2) function to find angle between two points relative to positive x axis
part of the code module after the zim.dist() function - these are functions not methods.
Added zim.placeReg(obj, id) function and zim 4th method to place locate a registration point relative to the obj
this then gives an output in the console as you drag and drop a little cross indicator (like place())
Adjusted zim.place() to output x and y and pos() data
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted the zim.Label to be up one pixel in the y on a button
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Fixed a bug in the Window where multiple windows would scroll together - missed a var declaration - oops (thanks Frank Los)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted zim.Pages to remove its children at the start - except for the currentPage (thanks Laura Warr)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong> Adjusted zim.Pages to not accept swipes or button clicks to go() until transition is finished (thanks Meagan Peat)
The ZIM Pages example http://zimjs.com/code/pages has been updated to modern zim code showing Pages, Layouts, Grids, Guides, and MVC
Fixed bug in frame.makeCircles - we had removed the frame module colors in favor of frame.blue, etc. and not adjusted makeCircles
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.9.1</span>
Added a resize() method to the Window to resize the dimensions without scaling the content
This allows independent scaling of the content to fit the width for instance in a long vertical scroll
Added a minSize property to the indicator property of the Window - already had the size property
For example:
indicator.size = 6; // the width if vertical or the height if horizontal
indicator.minSize = 12; // for the height if vertical or the width if horizontal
Added scrollwheel support to Window
Firefox has a canvas redraw glitch where it flashes unscaled/unpositioned content on full template resize
Implemented a fix where over 40ms the ticker.update is set to false and at 20ms the resize happens
It seems the requestAnimationFrame is catching the stage in a null dimension state or something...
Anyway - only on Firefox with full mode and a Ticker running - and fixed now. <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Adjusted Pad to default to an array of keys that match the rows and cols (of course!)
Adjusted Label to properly valign bottom and center when text is more than one line <em>CHANGE</em>
Also adjusted Label so bounds change when the text changes
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.9.0</span>
Added Loader class to upload files from desktop to canvas zim.Bitmap object and also save to new window
Added TextArea class to create an editable text box - it uses the HTML textarea tag and CreateJS DOMElement
Added outlineColor and outlineWidth to Label <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added selectedIndex to ColorPicker docs
Adjusted a few bugs with arrows in vertical steppers - hopeful that is all fixed - quite complex
Made alpha change dispatch change event as well from ColorPicker <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added return object of the animation target for a series
Fixed doubleclick glitch in zim animate created when a delay in protect was placed for animation series <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added dashed parameter to Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, and Button
and made either borderColor or borderWidth create a border and make the other parameter have a default
and made shapes be transparent if no color is specified AND a border is specified <em>BREAK</em>
otherwise passing null for the color will default to black (as it has all along)
This was a pain when you wanted a border without a fill - you had to set the fill to "rgba(0,0,0,0)"
Fixed Label clone when there is a backing - must clone the backing too ;-)
Rearranged vertical Slider to have min at bottom and max at top <em>BREAK</em>
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.8.2</span>
Added tab control in frame with tab highlight, highlight object and a number of parameters <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
This is demonstrated in the LeaderBoard of http://zimjs.com/code/zong
Will be expanding tab control - currently steppers and tabs - although any display object
can be added manually to the tabOrder.  So now tabbed to objects can receive an Indicator
Looking into screen reader support as well - although many things made in ZIM are visual.
Updated zim.fit() to take into account bound x and y when fitting.
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM Game 1.0.1</span>
LeaderBoard has integrated key and gamePad controls for entering name <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
An editing page has been set up to update five security options <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Automatic bad word filter has been added to the ZIM data mode <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.8.1</span>
Stepper updates - added press, rightForward, downForward parameters to Stepper <em>BREAK</em>
changed arrows to represent visual arrows - so set to false to hide them
added arrowKeys parameter to use or not use arrow keys - default true
changed default vertical forward direction to down unless numbers and then it is up
can change these with rightForward and downForward parameters
made it so mousedown immediately advances stepper (unless press is false) <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
this was an oversight - got missed when implementing hold parameters
or perhaps we did not want it to advance immediately if users are wanting to hold drag backwards...
Adjusted Label to accommodate backing in its bounds calculations - assumes if backing the bounds are that of the backing
Removed the default ZIM Wonder server parameter value as it runs the risk of being out of date <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Implemented a zimserver_url.js file that will always hold up-to-date domain:port urls for ZIM Socket, ZIM Wonder, ZIM Distill
In doing so swapped the server and notes parameters so this <em>BREAKS</em> previous signature - as server is required and notes is optional
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.8.0</span>
Added zim.GamePad() to handle game controller input for buttons and sticks <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added zim.MotionController() to handle moving a target object with the following types: <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
mousedown, mousemove, keydown, gamebutton, gamestick, swipe, manual
includes adjustable speed, damping, flipping or rotation, key/button mapping, firstPerson mode, etc.
Damp and ProportionDamp now return the object for chaining
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.7.3</span>
Changed zim.Ticker to use requestAnimationFrame with default no throttle <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
Added setTimingMode() static method to Ticker to go back to synched or timeout modes
setFPS(mobile, desktop) is still available but can lead to less than smooth performance
(NOTE: the initial launch of 4.7.3 was not quite right so we patched it a few days after)
added zim.sign(num) to return -1, 0, 1
added zim.constrain(num, min, max, negative) to constrain number to within and including bounds
added zim.dist(x1, y1, x2, y2) to calculate the distance between two points
Adjusted Frame to stage.update() on full mode resize <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
After canvas adjustment a few updates ago this was causing flicker
or things disappearing until next stage.update()
The stage will not update in full mode on resize if zim.OPTIMIZE is set to true
You will have to manually update the stage in your resize event function to see anything on the stage
Adjusted zim.Pane to not do anything to the text when you change it
If you want the text to be centered always, then start off with a zim.Label with align:center
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.7.2</span>
frame.loadAssets() now returns a zim.Queue object where we can capture events for a specific loading
Also there is an isLoading property on the Queue and reference to the createjs.LoadQueue with a preload property
The frame also captures these events for all queues as before and now has an overall isLoading property.
Thanks to Frank Los for prompting the changes and helping with the solution.
loadAssets() has a new time parameter to force the preload to wait at least this long in ms.
This can be used in testing and for when you want a minimum time to show a preload message
Added a showing property to zim.Waiter() and zim.Pane()
You can now loop an animation inside an animation series forever - it just will not proceed to the next animation
The set parameter for zim.move() and zim.animate() now lets you set scale (the convenience property for scaleX and scaleY)
Went back two updates to fix the loopCall parameter which was not calling when looping forever
since the change to the loopCall to not call on the last loop - use call for that (nice sentence!)
Added a zim.Dynamo() class to handle dynamic Sprite animation
You pass the Dynamo a Sprite, a base frames per second an optional label or start end frames
The Dynamo should be able to parse any type of CreateJS spritesheet data including nested animation labels
It turns these into an array of frames animates through the frames with percentSpeed available to adjust dynamically
The Dynamo also allows you to pause with a time delay or a on a frame number - and of course, unpause
Added a zim.Accelerator() class to handle dynamically changing speed and pausing of Dynamo and Scroller objects
This allows you to control the objects from one place to dynamically change the speed of a scene
Upddated the Scroller class to allow for pausing and percentSpeed
And the Scroller no longer has to be added to the stage to work
and in either case, the scroller backgrounds do not have to be on the stage to make a Scroller
See http://zimjs.com/code/zide/ for an example
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.7.1</span>
Added zim.interval(time, call, total, immediate), zim.timeout(time, call) that use requestAnimationFrame
Added zim.siz(width, height, only) for chainable size method
with either width or height, will scale the other to keep proportion unless only is set to true
Removed Dashed Lines - as CreateJS now does a dashed stroke. (<em>BREAK</em>)
Fixed Frame in full mode to resize canvas dimensions rather than create large canvas (<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>)
due to unexpected repositioning in apple devices (of course).
For instance, how can a canvas with no left and top be moved hundreds of pixels off the screen to the left
when switching orientations?  Even when left and top are set to 0px;  Get your act together Apple!
Problem is... it is a problem for ages.
Added a delay parameter to frame to make mobile devices redo a resize event to catch proper dimensions - default 500ms
made Pane and Waiter show() and toggle() chainable
adjusted zim.rand() to convert parameters that are NaN to 0
Adjusted zim.animate() and sprite.run() to let inner animation series loop forever
this will make the looping forever series the last animation to run in the series
added frame.clear (alpha 0), frame.white, frame.black, frame.faint to colors - faint is alpha .01 good for invisible interactivity
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.7.0</span>
major update to zim.animate() to run animation series
also better id control for pauseZimAnimate() and stopZimAnimate() <strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>
now documented as proper methods and with optional global control on zim directly.
removed zimTween from move() and animate() and added reference to zimTweens (<em>BREAK</em>)
removed stopZimMove and pauseZimMove - use stopZimAnimate and pauseZimAnimate for all (<em>BREAK</em>)
adjusted loopCall to not run after the last loop - that is when call runs (<em>BREAK</em>)
changed rewind props to be set after initial wait
added set parameter to move() and animate() to set properties at start of animation
updated docs for move() and animate()
Sprite.run() uses new animation series and stopRun() and pauseRun() use animation id system.
Sprite has json parameter which replaces spriteSheet parameter <em>BREAK</em>
The SpriteSheet is now made internally from the json
can still pass in rows and cols as well instead of json
added makeID() method to code module
frame now gives the stage read only stage.width and stage.height properties
added single param (default false) to zim Dictionary
added reg() and sca() methods for consistent shortcuts to regX, regY, scaleX and scaleY
</div>

<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.6.0</span>
added addTo() and removeFrom() functions / ZIM 4TH methods
these are wrappers for addChild() / addChildAt() and removeChild()
except they are consistent with center() and centerReg() where the obj comes first and the container is in the brackets
circle.addTo(stage); // rather than stage.addChild(circle);
circle.center(stage);
circle.centerReg(stage);
circle.removeChild(stage);
This also allows us to chain objects easier
var circle = new zim.Circle().addTo(stage);
var circle = new zim.Circle().addTo(stage).drag();
Added pos(x, y), mov(x, y), alp(alpha), rot(rotation), ske(skewX, skewY) functions / ZIM 4TH methods
chainable functions for common properties (a little shorter than set() method)
Note: pronounce mov() as "mawv" to differentiate from move()
mov() sets relative position in x and y - like circle.x += 100;
var circle = new zim.Circle().center(stage).mov(100); // shifts shifts to right 100
Added zim Swiper() class to Pages module to act like invisible slider with damping
Overhauled zim Sprite() to include the SpriteSheet and data creation
also added a run() method to animate the Sprite over time (see advanced ZIM Capture)
This gives two line Sprite animation with better control (<em>BREAKS</em> signature)
It still works with a CreateJS SpriteSheet if desired.
And optionally, you can pass in the JSON for the spritesheet.
Added keydown and keyup events to frame - wrappers for window events
Pages now dispatches a pagetransitioned event - not pageTransitioned (<em>BREAKS</em>)
removed secondary reference to colors in frame (<em>BREAKS</em>)
added frame.gray (already have frame.grey - these two are the same)
arrow keys for stepper now move secondary steps if in cross direction
also made stepper secondary arrows only show up for type of number
adjusted loop() to pass index, total, min, max, obj consistently as final params to call (<em>BREAKS</em>)
also added internal bounds to loop to handle out of bound step, start and end values
adjusted loop documentation to be more clear - should be the end of loop adjustments
corrected the zim Swipe docs to not include container properties
corrected frame variable (should have been this) to fix bug in strict mode
adjusted scaleTo() to scale to 100% in x and y when both are null - still default "fit"
so just using rect.scaleTo(stage) would fit the rect on the stage
previously, passing in no percentages would not scale at all.
adjusted typo in parallax Docs - scrolly should have been scrollY
rand() now has negative parameter to let you choose from a positive or negative range
ZIM Frame loadAssets() has been adjusted to include extra file types:
JSON, Text, XML, and SVG data can be loaded (as per CreateJS PreloadJS info)
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.5.0</span>
added a from parameter to zim.move and animate
you can set the from parameter to true to animate to current values from properties provided in obj
sequence in move and animate now works on a container as well as an array
added sequenceReverse parameter (<em>BREAKS</em> parameter order!!!) to handle sequencing through children (or elements) backwards
added a zim.ANIMATE global constant to prevent move and animate from running (eg. while testing)
added a check to move and animate for targets not on stage - to avoid the obtuse Ticker error message
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: updated Stepper with a bunch of new parameters:
hold, holdDelay, holdSpeed, drag, dragSensitivity, dragRange, type,
min, max, step, step2, arrows2, arrows2Scale, keyEnabled
also set keys work on Stepper only if they have focus or are first made
added focus property to Stepper
changed the strokeColor to borderColor - <em>BREAKS</em> old code... (sorry - now we consistently use border rather than stroke)
adjusted stepper to not return when setting currentIndex and index is same as currentIndex (might have changed the stepperArray)
also made setting the stepperArray update the currentIndex which will refresh the view
adjusted slider, dial, stepper currentValue to return if value set to undefined
zim.decimals(num, decimals, addZeros) will add zeros to decimal place if missing - for presentation
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: set drag to work if mouse is outside stage - on now by default - should have been on (oversight)
added a fadeTime parameter to Waiter and Pane to fade in and out for the provided milliseconds
added step, start and end parameters to zim.Loop took away total parameter (<em>BREAKS</em>)
added ZIM DUO to loop now that parameters are longer...
gave Circle a radius property get / set - that redraws the circle (not scales it like width and height)
Circle, Rectangle, Triangle parameter change - <em>BREAKS</em> zim DUO for the following:
color (not fill), borderColor (not stroke) and borderWidth (not strokeSize)
also the methods setFill(), setStroke() and setStrokeColor have been removed (<em>BREAKS</em>)
added borderColor and borderWidth properties - already have a color property
changed the borderThickness properties in Button and Window to borderWidth to match (and match css) - <em>BREAKS</em> zim DUO for these
added width, height, fullscreen parameters to zgo and shifted modal parameter to end (<em>BREAKS</em>)
made rand() set integer to false if a or b are not integers
added backing color to ColorPicker
fixed little glitch in animate() ticker paramater
Reordered EXAMPLES so ZIM 4TH versions come before the traditional zim functions
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.4.0</span>
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: hitTests improved by having mathematical hitTestBounds as filter
made it so can't add gradient or gloss if custom backing
fixed hitArea on indicator when square type is chosen
fixed indicator to update selectedIndex before dispatching change events
added swipe to window doc
made zim.loop() the name for all zim loops again and adjusted docs (<em>BREAKS</em>)
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.3.1</span>
Added read/write width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly properties to all zim displayObjects
Could <em>BREAK</em> old code where width and height were read directly from getBounds().width and getBounds().height
now they are getBounds().width*scaleX and getBounds().height*scaleY so they match the set width and height.
This is a fairly big change - now when you can set the width and this will adjust the scale to make the shape match the width inside the parent bounds
If you want to get the width of the bounds without scale - then use getBounds().width
It also means that the scale will probably be changed when you set width and height.
Hopefully this will not cause too many problems.  We went through the 64 ZIM Bits and adjusted a couple places
In one case we had to go back to the getBounds() but in another case it helped the app be more intuitive and we removed a tricky scale call
Added prop(property, value) method to zet to get or set the a property (or properties) of the set.
Adjusted docs to more explicitly list CreateJS methods, properties and events for each Build Module class
Made RadioButtons have a default of A, B, C
Fixed zim.drag surround to handle bounds with x and y not equal to 0 (like for a circle)
Fixed rotated container origin marking for zim.outline
Removed bound requirement from center.  Removed container bound requirement from centerReg
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.3.0</span>
introduced zim.extend(sub, super, override, prefix, prototype) which piggybacks on createjs.extend and createjs.promote
now all extends are done using this so that ZIM classes can be properly extended
this means that the createjs namespace must be loaded before ZIM - too bad, but that's okay
So if you load ZIM before CreateJS this <em>BREAKS</em> and gives a ZIM message followed by an error - most likely Frame is not a function
Just put the createjs script call above the zimjs script call.
all classes are now one function - had to add the scope parameter (this) to zob() for these.
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: fixed memory leak in Button - was not clearing mouseout event - off() sometimes does not work!
updated RadioButtons dot to default .7 alpha in color
fixed sequence to take into account the new loopCall and loopParams
had to adjust loop() so that a return is used to continue and a return with a value is used to break
return "continue" no longer continues it actually breaks - the function is only one version old so may as well fix it
moved loop() to code module and made loopChildren() in Create module for containers - may adjust this later
this <em>BREAKS</em> if you were using loop() on container
updated the Button description and added pizzazz to icon param description
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: added a rollPerSecond parameter to zim.Frame with a default of 20 checks per second (was set at 10)
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.2.1</span>
added a setBackings(newBacking, newRollBacking) to match the setIcons() in Buttons
also made toggle work for backings if there is no icon set and it is not a string (to toggle label)
adjusted the docs to wrap the signature of the function when you open a section
fixed clone of button to make sure all new paramters get cloned
adjusted hitArea of label to not be stored as the backing when no backing
as it caused clone problems - the clone then thought a backing was set when it was just the hitArea
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.2.0</span>
added icon and rollIcon parameters to button to accept display object like pizzazz2 icons
added setIcons(newIcon, newRollIcon) method to button to allow dynamically changing the icons
added toggle and rollToggle parameters to button to handle toggling the label or icons
added toggled property to button that returns true if in toggled stage and false if in original state
added toggle() method to button to force a toggle (or set state to true or false)
added 2px to height of text in labels to accommodate descenders
added loop() function to Create Module to loop or loop through children of container
tested with 1000 children and no speed difference
added isEmpty() function to test if object literal is empty
added loopCall and loopParams parameters to move() and animate()
and adjusted call to call after all loops and rewinds have finished
(always thought this was what it was doing but realized NOT)
this change <em>BREAKS</em> the signature - sorry - but hopefully you are using ZIM DUO config for this
added protect parameter to move and animate to ensure animation finishes
cancels any subsequent animation calls
added override parameter to move and animate to allow multiple animations on an object
without having to set props:{override:true} - does the same thing
updated ZIM 4TH version of move and animate to full parameter set
removed pauseZimMove, stopZimMove, pauseZimAnimate, stopZimAnimate when tween is done
added color property to stage to get or set background color (there already is a color parameter)
fixed dial setting currentValue if max is less than min
added read-only angles property [left, bottom right, top right] to Triangle
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>:adjusted zim.Dial to record last angle when clicked to avoid wrapping when not supposed to
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.1.3</span>
added stage.update to colorPicker when indicator present (follows zim.OPTIMIZE)
made indicator #111 when color is #000
added copyMatrix function to Create Module and use it in move, animate, setMask, drag and clone
made move and animate work with setMask to animate the mask (like drag drags the mask)
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.1.2</span>
ColorPicker has circles property added for circle swatches
ColorPicker has buttonBar property added to be able to set to false and hide buttons
added indicator parameter defaulting to true that shows currentColor
added selectedIndex property to ColorPicker
recorded lastColor and lastAlpha when setting selectedColor, selectedIndex and selectedAlpha
added id parameter to place method
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: fixed Button to center custom label after label bound changes in 4.1.1
added specific clone methods to Rectangle, Circle and Triangle
added rollPersist parameter and property to Button to keep rollColor when button being pressed even if rolled off
made slider use rollPersist=true
added gapFix back to scroller - still getting very thin gap if changing speeds - gapFix:1 should do it - default 0
adjusted move and animate to not run another animation for properties that are currently looping or rewinding
when these are done or the tween removed with stopZimMove or stopZimAnimate then animating these properties is okay again
problem was the tweens if overwritten would start from their last stopping spot
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.1.1</span>
added backing to Label
added position:absolute to Frame (fit, full, outside) so no styles required up top now
removed depreciated stageW and stageH properties from Frame (use width and height) (<em>BREAKS</em>)
fixed up bounds of label (I hope) and adjusted button placement
added fontOptions to Label clone
this could affect making a custom cursor out of a label - now need to set the mouseEnabled of label false
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.1.0</span>
Added backing and rollBacking support to zim.Button and zim.Pane (not rollBacking)
<strong>IMPROVEMENT</strong>: Fixed hitArea on zim.Label when centered
changed Pane move cursor to pointer
changed Pane backing property to backDrop to avoid confusion with new backing parameter
added toggle() method to Pane
added pointer cursor to Pane display when displayClose is true
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4.0.1</span>
Updated docs to have proper sentences for description.
Adjusted zim.Triangle() to make isosceles have a unique base number
(makes triangle symmetrical about the Y axis).  This causes different behaviour.
Fixed glitch in dragRect() for when no previous rect specified and localBounds set to true
Refactored zim.Window - added paddingVertical and paddingHorizontal
and indicatorDrag - which <em>BREAKS</em> the signature - sorry.
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 4TH - 4.0</span>
added zim Container, Shape, Sprite, MovieClip display wrappers
these extend are made from CreateJS counterparts
but they all have the ZIM Create functions added as methods
and they also have read only width and height properties based on getBounds
all ZIM display objects now extend a zim.Container
fixed zim.Drag glitch with removing zimDragTicker
fixed label to center properly when text is updated
adjusted documentation on width and height of button read only
added reference to AbstractContainer methods in all display object docs
added reference to createjs docs in docs
added RETURN values in documentation for every function
added EXAMPLE for every command in the documentation
added PARAMETERS for every function in ZIM Create module (already in other modules)
added global function isDUO to test if parameters are in config object format
added clone to all objects including cloned basic properties
and recursive cloning for Container and Window
moved Parallax and Scroller to the end of the PAGES module
this gives clean break with all display, shapes and components in BUILD
Renamed ZIM DISTILL to ZIM META
and added zim.Wonder to META
added a check to see if objects are on stage for all hitTests
added zil to fit and outside scale modes too
added fontOptions to zim.Label - for ordered font-style font-variant font-weight
did not realize that these can't be put after the font-size... sigh
adjusted gloss and gradient to not go over the border of the buttons
added startBounds (true) to drag() set to false to ignore bounds on start
inserted color parameter into Frame after height - will <em>BREAKS</em> legacy code
added css parameter to animate - set to true to animate html tags with css
added PARAMETERS section to all documentation
made section titles different color in docs
made example for each and have that be boxed
added props to normal parameters for animate and move

changed ZIM Frame to work on DOMContentLoaded and for delayed canvases, on document.readyState=="interactive" or "complete"
also made resize event trigger for all scale modes not just full
added sound parameters to asset().play(params) for {loop:-1, volume:.5}, etc.
drag default dragging cursor is pointer rather than resize
added swapHTML to swap innerHTML of two tag references
added zet(selector) function with on(), css() methods to apply events and properties to selectors

</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 2.6.1</span>
BUG FIXES
CREATE
fixed bug in zim.Ticker - was not storing stage when always was used alone
BUILD
added rounding to non-divisible steps in Slider
added inside parameter to Slider documentation
FRAME
added frame.tin for the #777777 color missing between silver and grey
added frame.purple for dark accent color
frame.lighter color needed an extra e.
ZIM 2.6.1 Updates - centerReg, labelColor, checks, makeCircles, etc.
CREATE:
added an add parameter (default true) to zim.centerReg()
which automatically adds object to the container if container is provided
so zim.centerReg(rect, stage); will center the rect on the stage and addChild to the stage
a touch of a risk as it may be better to always let people addChild - but I do this so often
that I thought I might bend a little.  You can pass false as a third param to avoid the addChild
BUILD:
added labelColor to Tabs and Pad classes (<em>BREAKS</em> signature near end - sorry) BUILD
updated Pad documentation
adapted Stepper label to use new centered Label text
added optional type of checkbox for x and square checks
RadioButton, CheckBox, Stepper no longer dispatch change events when set with properties like selectedIndex
so only dispatches change on user input - this changes the behaviour of older zim
FRAME:
has a 250 and 500 ms refresh added to resize events due to mobile delay in changing dimensions
added zon error message to missing sound assets so play() will not break app
added zim.makeCircles() function which ZIM circles for logo
TODO - move last placed object with arrows - CREATE
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 2.6</span>
CREATE
Added id to zim.place()
BUILD

must now set color and selectedColor to same to be like button
Fixed Tabs dispose
Fixed Button dispose
Fixed 0 glitch in Label "" == 0 what do you know!
FRAME
added ZIM colors as properties
edit all links to https:for cdn
-> need to add pause property to scroller
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 2.5</span>
MOVE & ANIMATE
added support for moving and animating an array of objects
including a sequence parameter to set time delay of animations on array
this makes marquees, etc.
this means that zim.copy() has to be copied into the stand alone CREATE module
added loopDelay property to move and animate props parameter
this adds a delay after the animation happens (and before a looped animation)
DRAG
Added surround, slide, slideDamp, slideSnap and reg params to Drag in CREATE
added dragRect() to dynamically set the drag rect in Create
TICKER
added Ticker class to Create module - and any that use Tickers
need to add Ticker class to stand-alone BUILD module
removed ticker parameter from any zim functions
made zim.move and zim.animate use the zim Ticker
made zim.drag use the zim Ticker
made zim.Parallax and zim.Scroller use the zim Ticker
MISC
added Dictionary class to CODE module
adjusted zim.mobile() to return "android", "Apple", "blackberry", "windows", "other" or false
Scroller added startPos and endPos params in BUILD
Fixed globalToLocal issues in Scroller
added place() method to CREATE to position things and get location in console
Added text property set and get to CheckBox in BUILD
Added display parameter to stepper to show or hide the text display
Fixed small bug in stepper in setting currentValue and currentIndex
added tripple screen support to max canvas size (which also fixes android sizing bug) in FRAME
added registration support to zim.fit() - might change your code!
added a display parameter to zim Stepper to show (default) or hide the display
switched the arrow direction on vertical Stepper too - sorry up arrow activates arrow on top (<em>BREAKS</em>)
added align parameter to text for left (default), center and right
fixed alignment formula for Pane
fixed target in zgo() for WRAP - was always opening in _blank
return v==null; used for zot(); in WRAP
Fixed Proportion to work with larger number first
consider default container.addChild(obj) for zim.centerReg(obj, container)
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 2.4</span>
ColorPicker component
gave slider a width and height property
fixed Waiter default shadowColor to #000 with alpha
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM 2.3</span>
CREATE
Added a hitTestGrid function
Added a paddingVertical to expand so can optionally provide different padding in horizontal and vertical
BUILD
added zim.OPTIMIZE and zim.ACTIONEVENT constants
OPTIMIZE defaults to false but if set to true, components will not stage.update for any presses or property sets (only for mouseover/out)
ACTIONEVENT defaults to "mousedown" and if set to something else then changes to click - can toggle this with zim.mobile() if desired
Added Tab component
added color and rollColor properties to set dynamically on button
fixed enabled bug on button (set mouseChildren false after re-enabling)
added color of label and roll dynamically
PAGES
exposed the regions object of the Layout class for dynamic alteration to Layouts - must call resize() after changing.

Made Stepper currentIndex property call a change event if set
Added enabled property to button, checkbox, radio, slider, stepper
</div>
<div class="updates">
<span class="version">ZIM DUO - 2.0</span>
We now minify all the modules and the full zim code under just the zim and version number, i.e. zim_2.0.js.
So no more _min.  The only file that is human readable has _doc after the version number, i.e. zim_2.0_doc.js.
Added zob() which allows us to provide a single configuration object for many of the zim functions
CREATE
animation loop fix

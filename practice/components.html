// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
var width = 1024;
var height = 768;

// as of ZIM 5.5.0 you do not need to put zim before ZIM functions and classes
var frame = new Frame(scaling, width, height);
frame.on("ready", function() {
    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

    var stage = frame.stage;
    var stageW = frame.width;
    var stageH = frame.height;
    frame.outerColor = frame.grey;
    frame.color = frame.light;


	// COMPONENTS

	// 1. Make a vertical Slider and center it on the stage - move it to the left 200 pixels and give it a min of 0 and max of 50.
	// Set the currentValue of the slider to 0
	// make the slider button frame.orange and round (width height 60 and corner 30) with a highlight color of frame.orange




	// 2. Make a Dial and center it on the stage and move it 300 pixels to the right and give it a min and max of the slider min and max
	// and a currentValue of the slider's current value  - Make it frame.orange and a width of 200




	// 3. Make it so when you slide the slider it turns the dial so the values match




	// 4. Make it so when you turn the dial the slider slides to match the values





	// 5. Add a ColorPicker with 4 colors - frame.orange, frame.red, frame.blue and frame.pink
	// Do not have a grey picker nor an alpha picker nor a buttonBar and give it a width of 300 and cols of 4
	// Add it to the bottom right corner of the stage with a margin of 30 at bottom and right
	// make is start with the selected color of frame.orange





	// 6. Change the color of the dial and slider to the color of the Picker when the picker changes color





	// 7. Add a frame.red Triangle at the top left corner that points to the right make the sides 100 pixels.
	// Make the Triangle flash 5 times and then stop.
	// When the Triangle stops, animate in from the right side of the stage at the same height as the Triangle
	// a centerReg'd CheckBox and make it stop 100 pixels from the triangle





	// 8. When the CheckBox is checked, show a TextArea that has the placeholder "Type and Press ENTER" to the right of the CheckBox.
	// When the CheckBox is unchecked, remove the TextArea - you will need to call the resize() method on the TextArea.
	// Make the TextArea 40 in size and a width of 500





	// 9. Use the keydown event of the frame to test for the keyCode of the ENTER key.
	// Use the TextArea hasFocus property (new to ZIM 6.7.3)
	// and if the TextArea has focus and the stage.contains(textArea) - contains() is CreateJS method then
	// add the text of the TextArea to a Label and position the label in the bottom right corner
	// also remove the CheckBox and the TextArea





	// 10. Make a function called secrets and call the function from the ENTER code above
	// pass in the text from the textarea or label as a single parameter
	// Create a variable called code that holds the first four letters of the letters in the TextArea or Label.
	// Use the substr(start, length) method of a String
	// also chain on the toUpperCase() method to turn the String uppercase
	// zog the code variable to make sure this works




	// 11. In the secrets function from now on!
	// Add a Pad of width 100 to the center of the stage with 2 columns and 2 rows that say the first four letters
	// Just pass the code string to the keys and use the toUpperCase() method of a String to turn them uppercase
	// make sure to update the stage




	// 12. Create an Indicator with 8 lights and set the fill parameter to true
	// Place the indicator somewhere nice - temorarily use the place() method on the indicator
	// drag the indicator and look at the pos() in the console - use the desired pos() to place the indicator.
	// Comment out the place() when you are done.




	// 13. Set the alpha of the indicator to 0 and when you first change the pad, fade in the indicator.
	// Use a check variable set to true outside the change event to say it is the first check
	// Then in the change event, if the firstCheck variable is true then fade the indicator
	// Then after that, set the firstCheck to false so it does not fade in again.
	// This is an example of logic - there is no functions, etc. for it - you make it with variables and conditionals




	// 14. Before or after the change event, make an array that holds two copies of each of your four letters
	// To do so, make a variable called double and store in it code concatenated to code (using the +)
	// Then use the split() method of a String to split the double string up by "" - this puts every letter into an array
	// assign this to var solution then use the ZIM global function to shuffle(solution)
	// zog the solution to see if you have your two sets of letters all shuffled in an array.
	// Create a var answer and set it equal to an empty array []
	// We will make a memory puzzle to let the user match their answer to the solution




	// 15. Back in the change event, push the pad's text property into the answer array.
	// Check this value against the solution at the index of the answer's length-1
	// if these are different then set the selectedIndex of the Indicator to -1 and set the answer array to []
	// if this letter is correct then set the selectedIndex of the Indicator to the answer.length-1
	// and stage.update()



	// 16. In the conditional for when the letter is right, also check to see if the indicator is full!
	// If the answer's length == solution.length then show a frame.yellow ZIM Pane that says "SUCCESS!"
	// Test the Pane quickly by testing to see if the lengths are not the same !=






	stage.update(); // this is needed to show any changes

}); // end of ready

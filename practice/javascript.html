// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
var width = 1024;
var height = 768;

// as of ZIM 5.5.0 you do not need to put zim before ZIM functions and classes

    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

	// JAVASCRIPT BASICS

	// Q1. Declare a variable called test on one line - do not assign anything.  [1]



	// Q2. Assign a String that says READY to the variable from Q1 - do not re-declare. [1]



	// Q3. On one line, assign an estimated percent Number to a declared varible, mark. [1]



	// Q4. Make a conditional so that if your mark is less than 80 you log to the console:
	//     Perhaps if I am ___________ I should get more than ____________.
	//     Where you put the value of the test variable (Q1 & Q2) in the first blank
	//     And you put the value of the mark variable (Q3) in the second blank.  [1]





	// Q5. What is it called when you join Strings or Numbers together?  (The long word!) [1]



	// Q6. Make a conditional that checks to see if test is equal to the String READY
	//     and if so then increases your mark by 5 otherwise decreases your mark by 2.  [2]







	 // Q7. Make an Array that holds 5 Numbers - any Numbers and assign it to a variable, nums [2]




	// Q8. Loop through the array with a loop and add up the numbers - you may need a variable!
	//     After the loop log to the console the total.  [3]




	// Q9. Loop again backwards through the numbers array and subtract the numbers from the total of Q8.




	// Q10. Make a variable called city hold an Object literal with the following properties:
	//      name, mayor and population.  Add values of your choosing to the properties.  [2]




	// Q11. Show TWO ways that you can access the mayor from your city in Q10.  [2]




	// Q12. Add a property to the city Object in Q10 called streets and make this
	//      an Array of THREE street names. [1]




	// Q13. Now use the push method of an Array to add a forth street name to streets above (Q12)  [1]




	// Q14. Assign the length of the streets Array (Q12, Q13) to a variable length
	//      Do not hard code - in other words, do not put length = 4. [1]




	// Q15. CIRCLE the TRUE statements below:  [3]
    //
	//      A. You can access a variable declared outside a function from within a function
    //
	//      B. You can access a variable declared inside a function from outside a function
    //
	//      C. If you do not declare a variable in a function it is automatically a global variable
    //
	//      D. We want to declare variables so they do not interfere with global variables


	// Q16. Write a time out to call a function called findMe after 2 seconds.  [2]





	// Q17. Write an interval to call a function literal (anonymous) every half a second [2]





	// Q18. How would I stop the interval from running?  [1]





	// Q19. Use the on() method to capture a mouse down event on an existing object called ball.
	//      Make the event call a function that will move the ball's x position over 100 each time.  [3]







	// Q20. How would I make it move the ball to a random y position between 100 and 500? [1]




	stage.update(); // this is needed to show any changes

}); // end of ready

// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
var width = 1024;
var height = 768;

// as of ZIM 5.5.0 you do not need to put zim before ZIM functions and classes
var frame = new Frame(scaling, width, height);
frame.on("ready", function() {
    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

    var stage = frame.stage;
    var stageW = frame.width;
    var stageH = frame.height;
    frame.outerColor = frame.grey;
    frame.color = frame.light;


	// CANVAS BASICS

	// 1. Briefly define the canvas that we have been using.  [1]

		// The Canvas is an HTML tag added in HTML 5 that lets you update an image with code.


	// 2. Make a green Circle with radius of 20 and store it in a variable. [3]

		var circle = new Circle(20, "green");


	// 3. Add the Circle to the stage in THREE different ways. [3]

		circle.addTo(stage);
		circle.center(stage);
		circle.centerReg(stage);
		// createjs: - not chainable
		stage.addChild(circle);



	// 4. Outline the circle on the stage to see the bounds, origin and registration
	// Which shape is registration?
	// What is the x and y value of the top left corner of the bounds of the shape [3]

	circle.outline();

	// the red circle - the + is the origin from where x and y inside the shape start
	// the x and y would be -20 and -20.  The bounds are measured inside the shape based on the shape's origin (the +)
	// the width and height of the bounds would be 40, 40
	// the shape's x and y is measured from the origin of the shape's container - so it would be stageW/2 and stageH/2


	// 5. Move the Circle to 100, 100 and make it half transparent and twice as big.
	// do this without chaining using properties and with chaining using methods [3]

		circle.x = 100;
		circle.y = 100;
		circle.alpha = .5;
		circle.scaleX = 2;
		circle.scaleY = 2;

		// with chaining (order does not matter but might if you are centering or centerRegging)

		circle.pos(100, 100).alp(.5).sca(2);


	// 6. What command is needed to make the above changes visible?  [1]

		stage.update();


	// 7. Make a Container as big as the stage and add it to the stage. [2]
	//    Call the container holder.

		var holder = new Container(stageW, stageH).addTo(stage);


	// 8. Make a Button with size 200, 200 and a label of "REMOVE"  [3]
	//    Center the button in the holder container.

		var button = new zim.Button(200, 200, "REMOVE").center(holder);


	// 9. Put a click event on the Button to remove the button from the stage [2]

		button.on("click", function() {
			button.removeFrom(holder);
			//createjs:
			holder.removeChild(button);
			// would recommend using ZIM functions as they always put the object first and are chainable
		   	stage.update(); // required
		})



	// 10. Write the line of code to load an image called egg.png in the assets folder. [2]

		frame.loadAssets("egg.png", "assets/");
		// or frame.loadAssets(["egg.png"], "assets/");
		// or frame.loadAssets("assets/egg.png")
		// or frame.loadAssets(["assets/egg.png"]);


	// 11. Assuming ALL your previous code is in the frame.on("complete", function(){});  [2]
	//     Write the code to add the egg.png asset to the container at position 500, 500
	//     Store the egg asset in the variable egg.

		frame.on("complete", function() {

			var egg = frame.asset("egg.png")
				.addTo(stage)
				.pos(500, 500);

			// or with createJS: 101 characters versus 72 characters for ZIM
			var egg = frame.asset("egg.png");
	    	stage.addChild(egg);
	    	egg.x = 500;
	    	egg.y = 500;


	// 12. Make the egg draggable.  [1]

		egg.drag();


	// 13. How would we make a copy of the egg?  [1]

		var egg2 = egg.clone();


	// 14. Animate the Circle from 0 transparency to 1 transparency in 1 second.  [2]

		circle.animate({obj:{alpha:0}, time:1000, from:true});

		// or

		circle.alp(0).animate({alpha:1}, 1000);


	// 15. Which parameter would we use to do something when the animation is done? [1]

		// call


	// 16. Other than a Button, name THREE components that help with interface.  [3]

		// Label, Slider, Tabs, CheckBox, RadioButtons, ColorPicker,
		// Waiter, Indicator, Pad, Stepper, Dial, Window, Pane


	// 17. Make a configuration object {} that holds the following three properties [2]
	// min, max, step with values of 0, 100, 2

	    	var obj = {min:0, max:100, step:2}

	}); // end load assets





	stage.update(); // this is needed to show any changes

}); // end of ready
